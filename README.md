## Installation

You can **install it as a PWA** on supported browsers:

1. Open the [kkalculator](https://darky-github.github.io/kkalculator-calculator) link.
2. Click the **install** icon in the address bar or browser menu.

## Tech Stack

- HTML (with inline CSS and JS)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Service Worker (for caching/offline support)
- Web Manifest (for install prompt/PWA)
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages**

---

## Notes

- Works best in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox with PWA support.
- Must be served over HTTPS (GitHub Pages does this by default).
- If testing locally, use a local server like `http-server` or `live-server`.
